- **Introduction**: 1989
- **Features**:
  - Superset of Bourne shell features.
  - Improved scripting capabilities.
  - Command-line editing.
  - Job control.
  - Shell functions and arrays.
- **Usage**: Default shell on most Linux distributions and widely used for both interactive use and scripting.

### 3. Korn Shell (`ksh`)

- **Features**:
  - Combines features of the Bourne shell and C shell.
  - Advanced scripting capabilities.
  - Built-in arithmetic operations.
  - Aliases and functions.
  - Improved interactive features.
- **Usage**: Preferred for scripting in some Unix environments, also used interactively.

### 4. C Shell (`csh`)

### 7. Almquist Shell (`ash`)

- **Developer**: Kenneth Almquist
- **Introduction**: 1989
- **Features**:
  - Lightweight and fast.
  - POSIX-compliant.

- **Developer**: Debian Project
- **Introduction**: Based on Almquist Shell
- **Features**:
  - POSIX-compliant.
  - Minimalist and fast.
  - Efficient for scripting.
- **Usage**: Default `/bin/sh` on Debian-based systems, often used in init scripts and for system tasks requiring minimal overhead.

### 9. Friendly Interactive Shell (`fish`)

- **Developer**: Axel Liljencrantz, others
- **Introduction**: 2005
- **Features**:
  - User-friendly and interactive.
  - Sane scripting defaults.
  - Syntax highlighting.
  - Autosuggestions.
  - Web-based configuration.
- **Usage**: Preferred by users who want an easy-to-use and visually appealing shell for interactive use.
