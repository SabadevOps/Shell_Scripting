Sure, here are the steps to run a shell script summarized in 10 lines:

1. **Open your terminal**.

2. **Create a new script file** using a text editor, e.g., `nano my_script.sh`.

3. **Write your script**, starting with the shebang line:
   ```sh
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ```

4. **Save and close the file** (e.g., in `nano`, press `Ctrl+O` to save, `Enter`, and `Ctrl+X` to exit).

5. **Make the script executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x my_script.sh
   ```

6. **Run the script** by typing:
   ```sh
   ./my_script.sh
   ```

7. **Check the output** in your terminal to ensure it runs correctly.

8. **(Optional)**: Move the script to a directory in your PATH for easier access.

9. **(Optional)**: Run the script from any location if in PATH:
   ```sh
   my_script.sh
   ```

10. **Done!** You have successfully created and executed your shell script.
